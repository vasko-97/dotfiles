" v-todo
" revise the g leader mappings.. don't need forward/back, gd can be used without leader. go to test? can add error nav here and free up e mappings
" consider making use of g keybinds. e.g. use go to go to top of page, then gg for something else.
" get vim working decently and in Git on windows
" make zt, zz, zb more ergonomic with leader keys maybe
" add better keybind for Ctrl+F12
" set Rider keybinds to avoid hitting Enter too much.. e.g. when picking intellisense value
" set good binding for Ctrl+W expanding highlight
" how to remove popups without hitting Esc and entering normal mode?
" set binding for RedesignedRunConfigurationSelector

" must have
    " - learn how to use notes directory with vim
    " - figure out registers remaps https://chatgpt.com/c/697266bf-72fc-8329-9410-8e9caf22d57c. X can probably be something more useful.
    " - zoxide (zi for fzf completion)
    " - flow launcher app opening
    " - flow launcher komorebi window switching on single workspace (I need to build this)
    " - flow launcher or fzf or everything or some combo for opening JetBrains solutions and folders
    " - collect bookmarks for swagger pages and various argo envs etc.
    " - raise issue with phantom tiles
" consider 
    " - consider remapping H, M, L. They're not that useful because if you can see where you want to go on the screen then there are better commands to get there
    " - consider remapping R again if mapping it to ciw is not that useful
    " - space out terminal windows over workspaces
    " - move very common actions away from leader binds to one keystroke combos.. e.g. reveal in file explorer, focus project view, search actions.. have R, H, M, L and Ctrl combos as good options
" nice to have
    " - lf or nnn or ranger (all integrate with zoxide)
    " - flow launcher everything not in must have
    " - use keepass from cli.. pass db password to stdin
    " - consider better diffs like difftastic for lazygit: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Custom_Pagers.md#emulating-custom-pagers-on-windows
    " - play with tool windows and settings and view modes and binds e.g. to maximise and minimise tool window
    " - incorporate Extend Selection somehow in IdeaVim if possible
    " - sesh (on linux) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HXQ12ff0_s&lc=UgwhicOm15i-rqKhVxN4AaABAg.ASypEfEJ4feAT5oQdkl62_
    " - wezterm for basic multiplexing
" currently getting used to
    " - try to get used to gp<leader>mr to reformat just-pasted code.
    " - make more extensive use of NERDTree.. https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim/wiki/NERDTree-support
    " - make more extensive use of Harpoon
    " - leave komorebi on for Teams calls
    " - Teams keybinds
    " - tool window management (<leader>t bindings, in DataGrip Tab focuses query, then Ctrl+G to copy column.., I've set Ctrl+Shift+./, to move next/prev tab instead of Alt+Right/Left)
    " - map file structure to leader keybind, then use for navigating to methods by name
